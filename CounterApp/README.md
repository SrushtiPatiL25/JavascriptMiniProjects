# 🧮 Counter App

## 📌 Problem Statement

Build a simple **Counter App** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to:
- Increment the count
- Decrement the count
- Reset the count back to zero

This is a fundamental beginner-friendly project that helps you understand how to interact with the DOM using JavaScript.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Display a number on the screen (initially 0)
- Provide three buttons: `+`, `-`, and `Reset`
- Update the displayed number in real time based on user interaction

## 💡 What You'll Learn (Strengths Gained)

This project will help solidify the following JavaScript fundamentals:

### ✅ JavaScript Basics
- Variables and data types (to store and update the count)
- Functions (to handle different button actions)

### ✅ DOM Manipulation
- Selecting elements using `document.querySelector()`
- Updating element content with `.innerText` or `.textContent`

### ✅ Event Handling
- Using `.addEventListener()` to listen for button clicks
- Associating functions with events

### ✅ Conditional Logic *(Optional enhancement)*
- Prevent counter from going below zero

## 🚀 Optional Challenges (to grow further)
- Add keyboard shortcuts for counter controls
- Change text color based on count (positive = green, negative = red)
- Animate number when it changes
- Save count to `localStorage` so it persists on reload
